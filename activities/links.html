            Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?
        </h2>
        <p>Those are the way how to connect differn website. But, the absolute is from outside, relative is from insde the folders. 
            The reason why we would use relative links is because we don't need to worry abour Updateing URL. And relative link is already inside of my folders. So, it's better to manage.
        </p>
        <h3> List the 3 rules with relative links. </h3>
        <p> 1. if it is in same folder - just put the file name
            2. if it is in child folder - folder.html/file.html
            3. if it is in up folder - ../file.html In this line ../ means going up</p>
        <h3>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</h3>
        <p>No, not always. </p>
