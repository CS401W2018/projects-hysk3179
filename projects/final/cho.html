    <p>Jokbo is a Korean family genealogy book that records the lineage, ancestry, and important information about a family's male descendants, often going back many generations. It includes names, birth and death dates, places of origin, and sometimes achievements or roles in society. Traditionally, only male family members were recorded, reflecting the patriarchal system of old Korea.</p>
