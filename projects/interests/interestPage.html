    <h1>Squid Game</h1>
    <p>One of my interesting is to watch Tv Show. Today, I want to introduce the Tv Show that I watched recently which is called Squid Game. The show is in a series, with season one came out on September 17, 2021. Recently the seasone 2 came out, with dates of December 26 and 2024.</p>
    <p>I was interested in a solid story and simple but unique characters, and many of the mini-games that are in the show, that I used to play with my childhood friends. While I watching it, I enjoyed them with my childhood memories. They are currently preparing for season 3, and it is expected to be released sometime in the summer of 2025.</p>
